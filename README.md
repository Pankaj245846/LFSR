# LFSR
Verilog HDL used for designing.
The linear feedback shift register is implemented as a series of Flip-Flops inside of an FPGA that are wired together as a shift register.
Several taps off of the shift register chain are used as inputs to either an XOR or XNOR gate. 
The output of this gate is then used as feedback to the beginning of the shift register chain, hence the Feedback in LFSR.
When an LFSR is running, the pattern that is being generated by the individual Flip-Flops is pseudo-random, meaning that it’s close to random. 
It’s not completely random because from any state of the LFSR pattern, you can predict the next state.
Longer LFSRs will take longer to run through all iterations. 
The longest possible number of iterations for an LFSR of N-bits is 2N-1. 
If you think about it, all possible patterns of something that is N-bits long is 2N. 
Therefore there is only one pattern that cannot be expressed using an LFSR. That pattern is all 0’s when using XOR gates, or all 1’s when using XNOR gates as your feedback gate.
